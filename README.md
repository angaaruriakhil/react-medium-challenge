# Medium Programming Topic Page Challenge

A React application built during week 5-6 of my software development course at \_nology.

This application is a 1:1 reconstruction of the [Medium Programming topic page](https://medium.com/topic/programming).

There is no functionality, but this challenge was a valuable exercise in achieving a specified design using SCSS, and how to lay out a hierarchy for components in React.

Placeholder pictures were taken from [Place Bear](https://placebear.com/).
